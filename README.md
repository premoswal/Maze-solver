# Robot Pathfinding in a 2D Grid

This project implements three pathfinding algorithms to navigate a 2D grid, where a robot moves from a start position to a target position while avoiding obstacles. The robot can move up, down, left, or right. The implemented algorithms are:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
3. **A* Search (A-Star)**

## Project Overview

This project is a Python implementation of three popular search algorithms to solve a robot pathfinding problem in a 2D grid. The grid is represented as a list of lists, where:

- `0` represents an empty space,
- `1` represents an obstacle, and
- `'T'` represents the target position.

The robot starts at a given position and attempts to reach the target using the following algorithms:
- **BFS**: Explores the grid level by level to find the shortest path.
- **DFS**: Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.
- **A***: Uses a heuristic (Manhattan distance) to prioritize exploration toward the target.

The output of each algorithm is a sequence of directions (up, down, left, right) that the robot should take to reach the target.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Programming language used to implement the pathfinding algorithms.

## Grid Environment

The grid is a 2D list where:
- `0` represents an empty space the robot can move through.
- `1` represents an obstacle that the robot cannot move through.
- `'T'` represents the target position that the robot needs to reach.

### Example Grid:
```python
grid = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 'T']
]
```

## Pathfinding Algorithms

### 1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- Explores all possible positions level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.
- Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (grid cells) and E is the number of edges.

### 2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- Explores as far as possible down each path before backtracking.
- Does not guarantee the shortest path, but may find a valid path faster in some cases.
- Time complexity: O(V + E).

### 3. **A* Search (A-Star)**
- An informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic (Manhattan distance) to prioritize nodes closer to the target.
- Guarantees the shortest path while optimizing exploration.
- Time complexity: O(E), where E is the number of edges.

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/robot-pathfinding-2d-grid.git
cd robot-pathfinding-2d-grid
```

### 2. Install Python (if not already installed):
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 3. Run the Code:
You can test the algorithms with the example grid provided in the `main.py` file by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. Customize the Grid:
You can modify the grid and starting position in the `main.py` file as follows:

```python
grid = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 'T']
]

start = (0, 0)  # Starting position of the robot
```

### 5. View the Results:
The program will print the directions the robot should take to reach the target using each algorithm.

For example:
```bash
BFS Path: ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right']
DFS Path: ['down', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'right']
A* Path: ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right']
```

## Example

Here's a sample run for the given grid:
```python
grid = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 'T']
]

start = (0, 0)  # Starting position
```

### Output:
```bash
BFS Path: ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right']
DFS Path: ['down', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'right']
A* Path: ['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right']
```

### How Each Algorithm Works:
- **BFS** finds the shortest path in terms of the number of moves.
- **DFS** explores deeply, but the path might not be the shortest.
- **A*** uses a heuristic to prioritize efficient exploration, guaranteeing the shortest path.

## Future Improvements

- Add more complex grids with larger dimensions and additional obstacles.
- Allow diagonal movement and modify the algorithms accordingly.
- Implement visualizations to show the pathfinding process in real-time.
